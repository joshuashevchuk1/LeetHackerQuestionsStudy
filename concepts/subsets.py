#Backtracking is an algorithmic technique used for solving problems incrementally,
# where you build a solution piece by piece and backtrack whenever you
# determine that the current partial solution cannot lead to a valid
# complete solution. Itâ€™s widely used for combinatorial problems,
# like generating permutations, subsets, solving puzzles (e.g., Sudoku),
# and finding paths in a maze.
