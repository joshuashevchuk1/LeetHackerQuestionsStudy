# Problem: Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
#
# You are given an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n-1,
# and an array edges where edges[i] = [u, v] represents a connection between nodes u and v.
#
# Your task is to determine the number of connected components in the graph.
