# BFS is generally safer in terms of memory and avoids issues with deep recursion in DFS.
# It may also be slightly more efficient in terms of handling certain grid shapes.
# DFS might be faster in cases where the island is relatively compact and doesnâ€™t require too deep of recursion.
# In terms of asymptotic time complexity, both BFS and DFS for this problem are O(m * n), so the difference in
# performance would not be due to time complexity but to practical considerations like memory usage,
# recursion depth, and specific grid shapes.
